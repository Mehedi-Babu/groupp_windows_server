# grouppvm

**GrouppVM** is a vulnerable Windows Server 2012 VM made for practicing specific Active Directory attacks. 

# Introduction
While doing Practical Ethical Hacking course from [TCMS Academy](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/) I noticed that one of the attacks required a HackTheBox subscription. After finishing the course, I realized thats the only attack which needs a HTB subscription in order to practice it. So, I ended up making this machine in order to help people get hands-on experience, without having to spend money on the subscription which isnt needed anywhere else in the course.                   

Although that was the main inspiration, this machine is free for use to anyone who wants to practice his Active Directory pentesting skills or have some fun.
# Installation
Installation is pretty straight-forward:
- Download .ova file (https://mega.nz/file/JLkQXRoT#3MA99LOwYMc4Pacft9oJReruMwm81Ukskwy0zqq--tQ)
- VMWare installation: `Open a new virtual machine` > Select Group.ova
- VirtualBox installation: `File` > `Import appliance` > Select Group.ova
- Configure network settings, RAM and CPU and play the machine!
